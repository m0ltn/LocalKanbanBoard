# LocalKanbanBoard
A fairly advanced local kanban board, code isn't pretty to look at but cloud services and lack of local boards annoyed me to the point of making this.

Features:
- Browser saving and loading
- Saving and loading to/from file
- modular task setup with customisable pieces (atm notes or checklists)
- priority based tags (no order filtering)
- drag & drop movement and reodering of tasks and groups
- complete indepency from any cloud services
- messy code :)

NOTE this site was created in my free time on the brave browser so testing for other browsers is basically noexistent and expect them to not work fully.
Feel free to use/modify to your hearts content, credit is appreciated but not necessary :)
Pull requests welcome
